            <h2>My personal thoughts</h2>
            <p>Learning html so far has been a fairly easy process. While I have learned some parts of other programming languages, this I believe this would still be an easy process for someone who's brand new. I have enjoyed learning how everything works together and creates the general structure of a web page. It's interesting to see something you've looked at for years be so simple the whole time</p>
        </section>
            <h2>What I have learned</h2>
            <p> I have learned copious amounts of entities, tags, attributes, ect. From forming a basic semantic layout of a webpage to adding special characters, all of it has been productive knowledge in my process. While I know there is still a lot to learn, I know this is still a big step in the right direction.<br>
                <br>
                Update #1: I have now been introduced into the world of tables. I have learned how to create a basic table using the &ldquo; &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, along with the headers, footers, and body.
